1. Download the zip file with the four datasets from https://github.com/danig89/Covid-19_Vaccine_Hesitancy/tree/database. Unzip the files into your local repository. 

2. Pull the Vaccine_Hesitancy.sql, DB_connection_to_ml_model.ipynb, and Vaccine_Hesitancy_Data_Exploration.ipynb files into your local repository. 

3. Open pgAdmin. Create a new database. Name it "vaccine_hesitancy". Once it has been created, open the query tool (right click on the database name in pgAdmin, and select query tool). 

4. Copy and paste the code from Vaccine_Heistancy.sql into the query tool. Run it. Verify that three tables have been created by going to Schemas -> Tables. 

5. In your local repository, create a .py file named config. In the file, create a variable named db_password. Set it to your password for the server you created the database in. I.E. for me my server is named "PostgreSQL 13". I created a file named config.py. In the first line of the file, I entered db_password = "password1". Save this config.py file in the same folder as the above .ipynb files! 

6. Open Vaccine_Hesitancy_Data_Exploration.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook. Verify your config.py file is in the same folder as the notebook, and that your unzipped datasets are also in the same folder. Run all cells in the file. 

7. Back in pgAdmin, use the query tool to query all three tables and verify they now contain data. I.E. SELECT * FROM census_demographic. 

8. If all tables contain data, congrats! Your database is now set up. You can use the code in DB_connecion_to_ml_model to import the code from the database and being training the model.
