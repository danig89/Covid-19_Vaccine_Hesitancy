## Background
This topic was chosen due to a shared interest in healthcare and public health as it relates to Covid-19.
<br>
(This section is not completed).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore which factors are more likely to contribute to an individualâ€™s hesitancy of getting (or not getting) the Covid-19 vaccine. By analyzing Covid-19, US Census, and demographic data, we hope to determine:
<br>
- Which demographic factors, such as income and proverty level, employment status, race/ethnicity, and access to transportation are more likely to contribute to vaccine hesitancy?
- Can we assume that counties that voted for Donald Trump are more likely to have higher populations of individuals who are vaccine hesitant?
