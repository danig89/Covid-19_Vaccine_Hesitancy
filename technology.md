# X - Role: Presentation - Deliverable 1 of Group Project.

# Background
The team member in the X role will focus on the technology side of the project. Consider these questions: Which tools are the best fit for your project? What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools. How will the dashboard be built? All of these different components play a large part in project efficacy, so knowing them beforehand helps smooth the workflow.

# Delierable 1: Technologies Used
Technologies Used: Illustrate each technology used for each stage. 
1. Data Cleaning and Analysis
2. Database Storage
3. Machine Learning
4. Dashboard

## 1. Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas and numpy will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## 2. Database Storage
Postgres and PgAdmin is the database we intend to use to store data.
SQLAlchemy will be used to load and connect to the data.

## 3. Machine Learning
We will use seaborn or matplotlib to perform our exploratory analysis. Our testing will be to illustrate which model is most optimal with the data we have. This is done via, sklearn Python Library.

## 4. Dashboard
Tableau Public will be used to present our data dn visualise our findings.

# Conclusion
The team discussed types of technologies used. Their conclusions are shown above. It is important to note that some flexibility is warranted and udnerstood by all team members. For example, if certain technologies are found to be not useful, new technologies will be used to ensure felxibility, adapatability and ease of use. The technologies listed above are the current understandings of flexibility, adaptability and ease of use among all memebers of the the team.
